# City Simulator

This is the code for my thesis titled "Design and Implementation of Interaction Simulation Application Based On Digital Identity". It is an interactive simulator that simulates the traffic and pandemic scenarios in a city ecosystem. It is used to showcase the application of Digital Identity.

The frontend is implemented with HTML, CSS and JS, and the simulator is based on [AgentMaps](https://github.com/noncomputable/AgentMaps).

The backend is implemented with Node.js and Express.js, and the database is implemented with [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db).

## Usage

1. Run `npm install` in `server` folder.
2. Start the server by running `node city_server.js` in `server` folder.
3. Open `city_main.html` in main directory to run the simulator.
